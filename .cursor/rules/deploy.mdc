# Talent Scout — Deploy reminder

When you make changes to Talent Scout (ai-sourcing-platform) or finish a task for this project, **always** end your response with the deploy instructions so the user can ship the update.

Use this exact block:

**Here is the code to deploy:**
```bash
cd /Users/alixbalevi/ai-sourcing-platform && quick deploy . talent-scout
```
Type **`y`** when prompted to overwrite, then refresh https://talent-scout.quick.shopify.io/
